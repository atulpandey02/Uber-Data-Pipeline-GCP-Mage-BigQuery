## Motivation
The primary goal was to design and implement an **enterprise-grade data pipeline** for transportation analytics using **Google Cloud Platform, Mage AI, and BigQuery**.

It demonstrates how **large-scale transportation data** can be ingested, transformed using dimensional modeling, and delivered as **analytics-ready insights** in an automated, scalable, and cost-efficient way.

The project reflects **end-to-end data engineering thinking** from raw data processing, star schema design, to advanced business analytics - simulating real-world data workflows in the transportation industry.

    # Create datetime dimension
    datetime_dim = df[['tpep_pickup_datetime', 'tpep_dropoff_datetime']].copy()
    datetime_dim = extract_datetime_features(datetime_dim)
    
    # Create location dimensions
    pickup_dim = df[['pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude']].drop_duplicates()
    dropoff_dim = df[['dropoff_longitude', 'dropoff_latitude']].drop_duplicates()
    
    # Create categorical dimensions
    payment_dim = create_payment_type_dimension(df)
    rate_code_dim = create_rate_code_dimension(df)
    
    return {
        'fact_table': fact_table,
        'dimensions': {
            'datetime_dim': datetime_dim,
